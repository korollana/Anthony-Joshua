        <h4><strong>Amateur career</strong></h4>
        <p>
           Anthony Joshua won the Haringey Boxing Cup for two straight years in 2009 and 2010. His twenties were a roaring success as he won all 18 fights at the Amateur level.
           This included winning the Senior ABA Championships. He turned down the offer of £50,000 to turn professional. In the European Amateur Boxing Championships in June 2011,
           he defeated Eric Berechlin and Chathal McMonagle. He was however interrupted by the Romanian Mihai Nistor. He was part of the GB Boxing Team and soon won the GB Amateur Boxing
           Championships. His performance in the World Amateur Boxing Championships in 2011 earned him a spot at the 2012 Olympic Games. He held an amateur record of 40-3 and was accorded
           the title of Amateur Boxer of the Year by the Boxing Writers Club of Great Britain in 2011. Though a novice internationally, his first appearance at the London Olympics was sealed
           with a gold medal in 2012 when he defeated Italy’s Roberto Cammarelle in the super heavyweight division. He made his professional debut under Matchroom Sport in October 2013.
           In the next three years, he remained undefeated in all his 19 fights. He earned his WBC International Heavyweight title when he was 24. He went on to defeat Gary Cornish to win
           the Commonwealth heavyweight title in 2015. He later defended this title when he won, albeit with some hiccups, against Dillian Whyte.
